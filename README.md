## Project Description
Battle of the Shadow Tome is a multi-player turn based combat game that is played online. This game allows player to battle each other using customized characters. This project was inspired by many of the games that the developers played growing up. This game was built to satisfy the requirements for project 2 of the UT Austin coding bootcamp. 

## How to Use This Project
1) Go to  [our game page](https://the-shadow-tome.herokuapp.com/)
2) If you would like to create a new game, click the CREATE button. If you want to join a game that your friend started, type in the unique game ID, then click the JOIN button

4) If you created a game you will now be taken to a waiting room until a second player joins the game. While in the waiting room you will be presented with a unique game ID, You will need to share that code with your friend so they can join the game.

5) Once both players have joined the game, you will be taken to the combat screen. When it's your turn, you will be presented with the option to attack, heal or attempt a heavy attack. The game will continue until a player is defeated.
